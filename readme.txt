== Description ==

**Kau-Boy's OpenSearch is deprecated and will be removed from the plugin directory on July 29, 2023, 13 years after its first release. If you still want to use OpenSearch on your site, I recommend switching to [Open Search Document](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/open-search-document/) which is still actively supported.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is my favicon not visible =

The favicon must be placed in the root folder of your blog (e.g. http://exmple.com/favicon.ico). That's not only usefull for the plugin but also very useful for all users visiting you page, as the browser will always request a favicon.ico in the root folder and you don't want your users to have a 404, do you?
